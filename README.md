Many people have been confused about the purpose of this tool. They say "Doesn't Autocad do that?" The point is not to create actual blueprints; it is to estimate the difference based on a change in input parameters. "How much more would it cost to make the house 6 inches wider? What about 3 feet? What about 50 feet?" The answers are not straightforward. Most materials are sold in discreet sizes. Why not add 200 square feet if the incremental cost is $15 in nails and foam?

The second question the program is built to answer is what is the total difference in price between different construction methods. This is also not straightforward as different methods may have different optimal dimensions.
